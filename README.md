# Pathfinding Project

A python module with a pathfinding program generating a random map and solving it if possible. The program displays the map, the solving processus and the path if there is a solution.
To solve the pathfinding problem, I used an algorithm based on this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L-WgKMFuhE).
